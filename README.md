# Introduction.

This repo is intended to show a ci for an ml model.

Create a branch adjust something small (e.g. the README.md), commit the change and merge the branch into the main branch. 

This should trigger a github action that trains a model to check if all is ok. Metrics are written to the comments track of the pull request.
